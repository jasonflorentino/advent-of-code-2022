# ðŸŽ„ Advent of code 2022!

Doing this year's [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2022). Just plain Javascript because I'm lazy. Nothing wild or fancy. Except maybe writing in a stream of consciousness, running it, and then hoping to one-shot the answer. Exhilarating isn't it?

# Run a solution

```bash
# day 03
node 03/solution.mjs
```
