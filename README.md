# 🎄 Advent of Code 2022!

Doing this year's [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2022). Just plain Javascript because I'm lazy. Nothing wild or fancy. Except maybe writing in a stream of consciousness, running it, and then hoping to one-shot the answer. Exhilarating isn't it?

## ⚠️ Spoiler Alert

The correct answers are in comments next to my solutions.

## 👟 Run a solution

```bash
# day 03
node 03/solution.mjs
```

## 🌱 Setup a new day

```bash
# Create folder + files for day 05
./newday.sh 05
```
